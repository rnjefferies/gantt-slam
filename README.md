# Gantt Slam - because building an app for your PhD annual review Gantt chart isn't really procrastination. 

## Build your own Gantt Chart with a simple shiny app.R

1. Clone this repository to your R workspace.
2. Install the dependent packages.
3. Run the app on your local host.
4. Make all the Gantt charts you desire!

#### WARNING - I only get 25hrs per month on this server, so it might not be active... 
But you can have a quick play with the app before building it yourself here: https://rnjcharts.shinyapps.io/Gantt_Slam/
